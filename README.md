Text-Based Adventure Game!

One of my first Python projects! I found it fun to learn
how dictionaries work and how they can be implemented.

I'll eventually be making edits to optimize this code &
create an even better version of this game, but it is functional
& fun to play!

Try & find Poseidon's Trident that was stolen by a sea monster.
User must first collect all 6 weapons to become strong enough
to defeat the Leviathan.
